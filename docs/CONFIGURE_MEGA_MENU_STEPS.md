# How to Configure Mega Menu with Categories

## Current Status
The mega menu CSS is working perfectly, but the menu has no content because it's not configured to use a navigation menu with child links.

## What We Found
- Theme: "Concept" version 4.2.1 (Development)
- PRODUCTS button currently links to `/collections/all` directly
- Mega menu block exists but has no navigation menu assigned
- Need to configure menu in **both** Navigation AND Theme Customizer

## Step-by-Step Configuration

### Step 1: Create Navigation Menu (Shopify Admin)
1. Go to **Shopify Admin → Online Store → Navigation**
2. Create or edit a menu (e.g., "Products Menu")
3. Add parent item "Products" with child links:
   ```
   Products (parent - can link to /collections/all)
   ├── Pallet Jacks → /collections/pallet-jacks
   ├── Trolleys → /collections/trolleys
   ├── Scissor Lifts → /collections/scissor-lifts
   ├── Ladders → /collections/ladders
   ├── Storage → /collections/storage
   └── Safety → /collections/safety
   ```
4. **Save** the menu

### Step 2: Configure Theme Customizer
1. Go to **Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes**
2. Click **Customize** on your Development theme
3. Navigate to the **Header** section
4. Find the **PRODUCTS** navigation item settings
5. Look for **"Mega Menu"** or **"Menu Block"** settings
6. Select the menu you created in Step 1 (e.g., "Products Menu")
7. Configure mega menu settings:
   - **Menu width**: Medium or Large
   - **Show menu images**: Optional (if collections have images)
   - **Promotional images**: Optional (1-5 promo cards)
8. **Save** changes

### Step 3: Verify in Theme Preview
1. In the customizer, the changes should appear immediately
2. The dev server at http://127.0.0.1:9292 should auto-reload
3. Mega menu will display with:
   - Multi-column grid layout (4 columns on desktop)
   - Category links from the navigation menu
   - Smooth animations
   - Proper centering and positioning

## Alternative: Check Current Theme Customizer Settings

If you already configured it in the customizer but it's not showing:

1. Open the theme customizer
2. Check Header → PRODUCTS menu item
3. Verify a mega menu block is added and configured
4. Check that it's using the correct navigation menu
5. Save and reload the dev preview

## Technical Details (CSS is Ready)

All CSS fixes are implemented and working:
- ✅ Fixed positioning for viewport centering
- ✅ Multi-column grid layout (auto-responsive)
- ✅ Animation triggers on menu open
- ✅ Pointer events enabled
- ✅ Proper z-index and shadows
- ✅ Scrollbar styling

The menu is ready to display content once you connect a navigation menu to it!
